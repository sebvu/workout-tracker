[categories.chest.bar_dip]
name = "Bar Dip"
primary_muscles = ["Chest", "Front Deltoid", "Triceps"]
commentary = "Bar Dip is a compound bodyweight exercise primarily targeting the triceps, chest, and shoulders, performed using parallel bars. To execute the dip, an individual begins by gripping the bars with both hands, arms fully extended, and body suspended in the air. As the exercise progresses, the person lowers their body by bending the elbows, allowing the upper arms to descend while keeping the legs straight or slightly bent. The movement should be controlled, focusing on maintaining proper form to avoid strain or injury. After reaching a comfortable depth, typically until the elbows form a 90-degree angle, the individual pushes back up to the starting position, engaging the core and ensuring stability throughout the motion. Bar dips are an effective way to build upper body strength and can be modified in difficulty by adjusting the body angle or adding weights."
instructions = [
	"Grip a dip station about shoulder-width apart, and climb or jump to get into the starting position.",
