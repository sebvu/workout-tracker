[categories.chest.bar_dip]
primary_muscles = ["Chest", "Front Deltoid", "Triceps"]
commentary = "Bar Dip is a compound upper body exercise primarily targeting the triceps, shoulders, and chest. Performed on parallel bars, the movement begins with the athlete suspending their body with arms fully extended and shoulders retracted, creating a stable starting position. As the athlete descends, they bend their elbows to lower their body while leaning slightly forward, ensuring an effective engagement of the chest and triceps. The movement is completed by fully extending the arms to return to the starting position. Bar Dips not only enhance strength and muscle definition but also improve functional fitness and stability, making them a valuable addition to any strength training regimen."
instructions = [
	"Grip a dip station about shoulder-width apart, and climb or jump to get into the starting position.",

It is typically performed on a back extension machine or stability ball, where the individual lies face down with their hips supported and legs secured. The movement involves lowering the upper body towards the ground and then lifting it back to a straight position, engaging the core and glutes throughout the motion. This exercise not only enhances spinal stability and posture but also helps to improve overall back strength, making it beneficial for athletes and those seeking to alleviate lower back pain. Proper form is crucial to avoid strain; therefore, it is recommended to maintain a neutral spine and avoid hyperextending the back during the lift."
