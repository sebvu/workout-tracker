name = "Bar Dip"
primary_muscles = ["Chest", "Front Deltoid", "Triceps"]
commentary = "Bar dips are a compound upper body exercise that primarily targets the triceps, chest, and shoulders. To perform a bar dip, an individual uses parallel bars for support, lowering their body by bending the elbows until the shoulders are below the elbows, then pushing back up to the starting position. This movement not only builds strength in the targeted muscle groups but also engages the core, promoting stability and balance. Bar dips can be modified for different skill levels, such as keeping the legs extended for added challenge or bending the knees for beginners. Regular practice can lead to improved muscle definition and functional strength."
instructions = [
	"Grip a dip station about shoulder-width apart, and climb or jump to get into the starting position.",
	"Lower yourself with control until your shoulder is below your elbow, or as deep as you comfortably can.",

name = "Bench Press"
primary_muscles = ["Chest", "Front Deltoid"]
secondary_muscles = ["Triceps"]
commentary = "The bench press is a fundamental strength training exercise primarily targeting the pectoral muscles, shoulders, and triceps. Performed lying on a flat bench, the lifter grips a barbell or dumbbells, lowering the weight to chest level before pressing it back to the starting position. This movement engages the upper body, promoting muscle hypertrophy, functional strength, and stability. Variations include incline and decline bench presses, which shift the focus to different muscle areas. Proper form is essential to prevent injury, and it's often recommended to use a spotter or safety equipment for heavier lifts."
instructions = [
	"Lie on the bench, pull your shoulder blades together and down, and slightly arch your back.",
